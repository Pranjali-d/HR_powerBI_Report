### Insights:
1. 1470 employees, 72 of whom have not been promoted for 10 years or more, need to be promoted.
2. The majority of the employees have been working for at least 5 years. There are 44 new employees.
3. 117 employees who have been with the company for 18 years or more need to be laid off. The employees’ job levels are mainly 1 and 2.
4. 47 employees in the research and development department will be promoted, and 74 will be laid off. The biggest change is seen in this department.
5. The employees’ job satisfaction levels do not create significant differences. Although there are more employees with high job satisfaction, 459 employees have low job  satisfaction.
6. Approximately 30% of the employees work overtime.
7. 84.6% of the employees have a high performance rating. 15.4% have a low performance rating.
8. The sales manager role has the highest number of employees. The highest number of promotions and layoffs are in the manager role.
  
  
### Recommendations :
1. There are 72 employees out of 1470 who will be promoted. This number was determined for those who have not been promoted for 10 years or more. If the chance of promotion is given in shorter periods instead of a minimum of 10 years, employee motivation can be increased.
2. Instead of laying off 117 employees with 18 years or more of service all at once, a performance-based layoff can be implemented.
3. In-service training can be provided to level 1 and 2 employees to improve their skills and advance their levels.
4. Interviews can be conducted with employees who have low job satisfaction levels to analyze the reasons. Then, improvement efforts should be made to address their concerns.
